##Target for Assignment-3X:

Make a network that has:

    6 Convolution layers with these kernels (10, 10, 20, 20, 30)
    no fully connected layer (you probably may have to use the Global Average Pooling layer)
    uses EMNIST as the dataset
    uses a maximum of 2 max-pooling layers
    must be trained for minimum of 20 epochs

I used 6 converlution layer with the given kernel sizes and trained for the EMNIST dataset. 

At the lost i got some issue.
